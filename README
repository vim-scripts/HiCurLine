This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=555

This script has a number of maps that intercept various motions and cause the current line to be highlighted.  It is a variant of <HiMtchBrkt.vim> (vimtip#177).

    \hcli : initiate HiCurLine operation
    \hcls : stop HiCurLine operation

(see vimtip#411 to have HiCurLine automatically begin highlighting)

HiCurLine.vim uses the HL_HiCurLine highlighting group (by default) to specify the highlighting of the current line.  One may change the highlighting group HiCurLine uses with the g:HL_HiCurLine variable.  By default,

	let g:HL_HiCurLine= "HL_HiCurLine"

and <HiCurLine.vim> will specify that group internally.  Otherwise, one may change the group used to whatever one wishes:

	let g:HL_HiCurLine= "Search"
	let g:HL_HiCurLine= "Function"

etc.  The default highlighting is: (background is a setting, see :he 'bg')

	background == dark : blue text on cyan background
	background == light: cyan text on blue background
